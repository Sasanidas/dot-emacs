* Foreword

This is a little novel for casual reading about a text editor. Incidentally, it
also works as an Emacs configuration file.

WARNING: WORK IN PROGRESS!

* UI customization

** Lean and mean

Emacs doesn't need a lot of UI elements - it should be lean and mean. Well, and
clean, and it should look good on the screen.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (if (fboundp 'tool-bar-mode) (tool-bar-mode -1))
  (if (fboundp 'scroll-bar-mode) (scroll-bar-mode -1))
  (setq inhibit-startup-message t)
#+END_SRC

** Dark tango

For some reason, my eyes like dark background. Not pitch black, but pretty
black.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun configure-theme ()
    "Make Emacs pretty"
    (load-theme 'tango-dark)
    (enable-theme 'tango-dark)
    ;; make background a little bit darker
    (set-background-color "#1d1f21"))

  (configure-theme)
#+END_SRC

** Deja Vu

DejaVu fonts family is simply the best one out there. And DejaVu Sans Mono is
the brightest child in the family:

- it covers a hell lot of Unicode symbols
- it's community-driven and MIT/public domain licensed
- it makes l, 1 and I clearly distinguishable, as well as 0 and O
- it's beautiful looking

Basically, DejaVu Sans Mono is a "font done right" for technical work.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (ignore-errors
    (set-frame-font
     (car (x-list-fonts "-*-DejaVu Sans Mono-normal-normal-normal-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1"))))
#+END_SRC

** Forbidden fruit

This section is supposed to make Emacs more usable on Mac's, but since I've
never owned a Mac, I can't really tell whether it works at all. If you own a
Mac, please, enlighten me!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
#+END_SRC
